h1. Test OpenID Consumer for the rots Gem.

To get started you will have to do the following commands:

  $ bin/thor merb:gem:install
  $ bin/rake db:automigrate

After this you should have all the dependent gems bundled on the project. Next, you run the rots server in the project

  $ bin/rots

And in another terminal window, you would like to execute the OpenID tests using merb_cucumber:

  $ bin/rake features

If you want to check out the test code, go to the features/ folder, and check the features/openid_authentication.feature file and the features/steps/openid_steps.rb, this gem is using Webrat:"http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master"

Send me a message to roman @ github if you have any doubts on how to use this.
